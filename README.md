### Assignment 1: Static Site Generation with 11ty
**Framework:** **11ty**

#### Objective: 
- Introduce students to the concept of static site generation (SSG) and how to create a performant, modular static website using 11ty.

#### Requirements:
- **Static Site Creation:** Use 11ty to create a multi-page static website with at least 4 pages.
- **Reusable Components:** Implement reusable components such as headers, footers, and navigation menus using 11ty’s templating language (e.g., Nunjucks).
- **Content Integration:** Use Markdown or JSON files to dynamically generate content for different pages (e.g., blog posts, project listings).
- **Performance Optimization:** Apply build-time optimizations like HTML minification, image optimization, and asset bundling.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the static site to a hosting platform like Netlify or Vercel.

#### Deliverables:
- A GitHub repository containing the complete 11ty project.
- A live demo URL showcasing the deployed site.
- A brief documentation explaining the site structure, components used, and the deployment process.

#### Class Demo App:
- **Demo:** Build a personal portfolio site using 11ty.
  - **Features:** Home page, About page, Projects page (using JSON/Markdown data for projects), Contact page.
  - **Concepts Covered:** Templating, data-driven content generation, build-time optimization, and deployment.

### Assignment 2: Single Page Application (SPA) with React (or other framework)
**Framework:** **React**

#### Objective: 
- Build a dynamic single-page application (SPA) to understand React’s component-based architecture, state management, and client-side routing.

#### Requirements:
- **SPA Development:** Create an SPA with at least 6 components (e.g., Header, Footer, Navigation, Main Content, List Component, and a Form Component).
- **Routing:** Implement client-side routing using `react-router` to navigate between different pages/views.
- **State Management:** Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) or Context API to manage the application’s state and data flow between components.
- **Dynamic Data Handling:** Fetch and display dynamic data from an external API or mock API to demonstrate data fetching and state updates.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensure the application is responsive and cross-browser compatible.

#### Deliverables:
- A GitHub repository with the React project.
- A live demo hosted on a platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
- A short report describing the application architecture, components, and data management strategy.

#### Class Demo App:
- **Demo:** Create a simple to-do list application using React.
  - **Features:** Add, edit, and delete to-do items, mark items as complete, and filter items based on their status.
  - **Concepts Covered:** Component creation, state management with hooks, client-side routing, and interaction with an external or mock API.

### Assignment 3: Advanced Web Application with Next.js and Server-Side Rendering
**Framework:** **Next.js**

#### Objective: 
- Build a modern web application using Next.js to explore server-side rendering (SSR), static generation, and integrating a headless CMS.

#### Requirements:
- **SSR and SSG:** Implement both server-side rendering and static site generation within the application to optimize performance and SEO.
- **Headless CMS Integration:** Integrate with a headless CMS like Contentful, Sanity, or Strapi to fetch and display content dynamically.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Use Next.js’s file-based routing system to create dynamic routes for pages like blog posts or products.
- **API Routes:** Create custom API routes in Next.js to handle data fetching or server-side logic for more complex interactions.
- **SEO Optimization:** Implement SEO best practices, including dynamic meta tags, Open Graph tags, and structured data.

#### Deliverables:
- A GitHub repository containing the Next.js project.
- A deployed version of the application on Vercel.
- A brief report detailing the CMS integration, rendering strategies used, dynamic routing, and API route creation.

#### Class Demo App:
- **Demo:** Build a blog application using Next.js and a headless CMS (e.g., Contentful).
  - **Features:** Fetch and display blog posts from the CMS, implement SSR for the blog post pages, create dynamic routes for individual blog posts.
  - **Concepts Covered:** Data fetching with `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`, integrating a headless CMS, dynamic routing, and SSR/SSG strategies.
